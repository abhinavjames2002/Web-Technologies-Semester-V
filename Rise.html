                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                We're gonna ri—, ri—, ri—, ri—, rise 'til we fall.<br>
                They say we got no, no, no, no future at all.<br>
                They wanna ke—, ke—, keep us out. Can't hold us down anymore.<br>
                We're gonna ri—, ri—, ri—, ri—, rise 'til we fall.<br>
                <br>
                When we hit the bottom,<br>
                Nothin' gon' stop us.<br>
                Climb to the top with you.<br>
                We could be the greatest,<br>
                Ones who never made it.<br>
                Yeah, I could be talking to you.<br>
                <br>
                They tryna hate, hate, hate,<br>
                But we won't change, change anything at all.<br>
                We're gonna ri—, ri—, ri—, ri—, rise 'til we fall.<br>
                <br>
                They think we're just drop-outs<br>
                Living at our mom's house.<br>
                Parents must be so proud.<br>
                They know it all.<br>
                <br>
                No, they don't speak our language.<br>
                They say we're too savage.<br>
                No, no. We don't give a—anymore.<br>
                <br>
                We're gonna ri—, ri—, ri—, ri—, rise 'til we fall.<br>

                <br>
                We're gon' keepin' on, keepin' on going til' we can't go no more.<br>
