                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Found you when your heart was broke<br>
                I filled your cup until it overflowed<br>
                Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)<br>
                I was afraid to leave you on your own<br><br>

                I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)<br>
                And if they laugh, then f*** 'em all (all)<br>
                And then I got you off your knees<br>
                Put you right back on your feet<br>
                Just so you could take advantage of me<br><br>

                Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?<br>
                Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me<br>
                You know I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Baby, I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Live without me<br>
                Baby, I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)<br><br>

                Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)<br>
                Just running from the demons in your mind<br>
                Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)<br>
                I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind<br><br>

                Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)<br>
                And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)<br>
                And then I got you off your knees<br>
                Put you right back on your feet<br>
                Just so you could take advantage of me<br><br>

                Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?<br>
                Feeling so high but too far away to hold me<br>
                You know I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Baby, I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Live without me<br>
                Baby, I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                I don't know why, yeah<br><br>

                You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)<br>
                I already know (I know)<br>
                I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)<br>
                So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)<br><br>

                Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?<br>
                Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me<br>
                You know I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Thinking you could live without me<br>
                Baby, I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)<br><br>
