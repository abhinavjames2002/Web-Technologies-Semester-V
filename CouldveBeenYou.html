                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                L.A. f***ing changed you<br>
                You were different person all of a sudden<br>
                But honestly I've changed too<br>
                I guess I'm not the type that you wanted<br>
                <br>
                'Cause my love didn't face you<br>
                I bought you Gucci before I could afford it<br>
                Would have given out a world to you<br>
                But then I've never heard from you<br>
                <br>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
                One day you'll come running back, back, back<br>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
                But it'll be too late for that<br>
                <br>
                I'm doing what we've dreamed of<br>
                With somebody new<br>
                Going to the places<br>
                That you wanted to<br>
                It could have been you<br>
                It could have been you<br>
                <br>
                I bet you see the pictures<br>
                Popped up on your phone<br>
                I know that it kills you<br>
                That I'm not alone<br>
                It could have been you<br>
                It could have been you<br>
                <br>
                It could have been<br>
                You<br>
                It coulve have been<br>
                You<br>
                It could have been<br>
                <br>
                But L.A. fucking changed me<br>
                And trust me when I say for the better<br>
                I moved on 'cause you made me<br>
                Made me<br>
                Now my cologne on new girl's sweather<br>
                <br>
                And she's fucking amazing<br>
                I knew it from the moment I've met her<br>
                And I might give a world to her<br>
                And give her what you don't deserve<br>
                <br>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
                One day you'll come running back, back, back<br>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
                But it'll be too late for that<br>
