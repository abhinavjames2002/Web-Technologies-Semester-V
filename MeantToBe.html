                Had a dream of us<br>
                But my heart's growing cold when I know that you're not with me<br>
                I did dream of us<br>
                Baby, your heart is here, baby, your heart is here<br>
                Was it not enough<br>
                When we loved, when we touched, I just missing having you near me<br>
                Was it not enough<br>
                Baby, your heart is here, baby your heart is here<br>
                <br>
                'Cause I know that I can't live without you loving me<br>
