                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                What's the trick? I wish I knew<br>
                I'm so done with thinking through<br>
                All the things I could've been<br>
                And I know you wonder too<br><br>

                All it takes is that one look you do<br>
                And I run right back to you<br>
                You crossed the line<br>
                And it's time to say "F... you"<br><br>

                What's the point in saying that<br>
                When you know how I'll react?<br>
                You think you can just take it back<br>
                But shit just don't work like that<br><br>

                You're the drug that I'm addicted to<br>
                And I want you so bad<br>
                Guess I'm stuck with you<br>
                And that's that<br><br>

                'Cause when it all falls down<br>
                Then whatever<br>
                When it don't work out<br>
                For the better<br>
                If it just ain't right<br>
                And it's time to say goodbye<br>
                When it all falls down<br>
                When it all falls down<br><br>

                I'll be fine, I'll be fine<br>
                You're the drug that I'm addicted to<br>
                And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine<br><br>

                Why we fight? I don't know<br>
                We say what hurts the most<br>
                Oh, I try staying cold<br>
                But you take it personal<br><br>

                All these firing shots<br>
                And making ground<br>
                It's way too hard to cope<br>
                But I still can't let you go<br><br>

                'Cause when it all falls down<br>
                Then whatever<br>
                When it don't work out<br>
                For the better<br>
                If it just ain't right<br>
                And it's time to say goodbye<br>
                When it all falls down<br>
                When it all falls down<br><br>

                I'll be fine, I'll be fine<br>
                You're the drug that I'm addicted to<br>
                And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine<br><br>

                I'll be fine, fine<br>
                (All falls down)<br>
                I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
                I fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
                (Falling down)<br>
                (All falls down)<br>
                I'll be fine, fine, fine<br><br>

                I fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
                (All falls down)<br>
                I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
                I fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
                (Falling down)<br>
                (All falls down)<br>
                I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
                I fine, fine<br><br>

                'Cause when it all falls down<br>
                Then whatever<br>
                (Then whatever, babe)<br>
                When it don't work out<br>
                For the better<br>
                (For the better)<br>
                If it just ain't right<br>
                (If it just ain't right)<br>
                And it's time to say goodbye<br>
                When it all falls down<br>
                (When it all, when it all)<br>
                When it all falls down<br>
                (When it all falls down)<br><br>

                I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)<br>
                I'll be fine (I'll be fine)<br>
                You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad<br>
                But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that<br><br>
