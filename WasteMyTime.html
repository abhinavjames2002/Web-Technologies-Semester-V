                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                Youâ€™re always such a rush<br>
                I'm all good when I'm by your side<br>
                I'm not askin' much<br>
                Only for the time of my life<br>
                <br>
                I know you're not the one that I need<br>
                But it doesn't change the way that I feel, yeah<br>
                I should turn around and leave<br>
                But I'm still here<br>
                <br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time<br>
                I don't really care if you ain't mine<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight<br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time<br>
                'Cause it means I get to look in those eyes<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight<br>
                So go ahead and waste my time<br>
                <br>
                I don't need no trust<br>
                All that I get is all that I see<br>
                What we got is enough<br>
                You can be you, and I can be me<br>
                <br>
                You know I'm not the one that you need<br>
                But it doesn't change the way that I feel, yeah<br>
                I should turn around and leave<br>
                But I'm still here<br>
                <br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time (my time)<br>
                I don't really care if you ain't mine (ain't mine)<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight<br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time (my time)<br>
                'Cause it means I get to look in those eyes<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight<br>
                So go ahead and waste my time<br>
                <br>
                All night, if you got nothin' then come by<br>
                All day, all night, if it's wrong why does it feel right<br>
                <br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time<br>
                I don't really care if you ain't mine<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight (ain't no need to think beyond tonight)<br>
                <br>
                I kinda like it when you waste my time (my time)<br>
                'Cause it means I get to look in those eyes (those eyes)<br>
                Got me feelin' like there ain't no need to think beyond tonight<br>
                <br>
                So go ahead and waste my time<br>
                All day, all night<br>
                So go ahead and waste my time<br>
                All day, all night<br><br>
