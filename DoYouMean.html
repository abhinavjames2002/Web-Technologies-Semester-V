                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                What you said, no, you can't take away<br>
                You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith<br><br>

                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?<br>
                What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away<br><br>

                Show me that you mean it, ay<br>
                Show me that you mean it<br>
                Do you really mean it, ay<br>
                Everything happens for a reason<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br><br>

                I hope you mean what you say, girl<br>
                Hope you ain't lying to my face, girl<br>
                You said you needed some space, girl<br>
                I tried to stay out your way, girl<br>
                You heard some stories about my past, hey<br>
                Wish we could leave them in the past, hey<br>
                You said it's hard for you to trust again<br>
                I wonder if you're really over it<br><br>

                Bounce back like a rebound<br>
                Are you saying what you mean now?<br><br>

                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                What you said, no, you can't take away<br>
                You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith<br><br>

                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?<br>
                What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away<br><br>

                Show me that you mean it, ay<br>
                Show me that you mean it<br>
                Do you really mean it, ay<br>
                Everything happens for a reason<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br><br>

                Time's up, what you gonna say next?<br>
                Can't hide what you did to me, yeah<br>
                Put you out like a cigarette<br>
                Put me out of my misery, yeah<br>
                It's not you it's me<br>
                Come on, seriously<br>
                Heard that once or twice before<br>
                You got that straight from a movie<br><br>

                Bounce back like a rebound<br>
                Are you saying what you mean now?<br><br>

                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                What you said, no, you can't take away<br>
                You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith<br><br>

                Do you mean, do you mean what you say?<br>
                Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?<br>
                What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away<br><br>

                Show me that you mean it, ay<br>
                Show me that you mean it<br>
                Do you really mean it, ay<br>
                Everything happens for a reason<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br>
                Show me that you mean it (Do you? Do you?)<br><br>
