                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                I'll tell you something you need to know<br>
                Nothing I can say from the phone<br>
                I'll tell you something, we have to see 'cause<br>
                You're the one that I miss the most<br><br>
                
                I've heard that you're happy<br>
                And maybe it's selfish of me<br>
                To want you back this time<br>
                I know we decided if we both were free<br>
                But it kills me now<br><br>

                We said our last goodbye<br>
                Won't you stay the night?<br>
                Even just for a moment<br>
                Perfect night, pretend we're fine<br>
                Even just for a moment<br>
                Nowhere over, we're still not over<br>
                Pull me closer, I need closure<br>
                This is our last goodbye<br>
                Stay the night, even just for a moment<br>
                Even just for a moment<br><br>

                When you're not hurting<br>
                It's hurting me (hurting me)<br>
                I'm blinded by the past<br>
                I'm lost at sea (mm)<br><br>

                I've heard that you're happy<br>
                And maybe it's selfish of me<br>
                To want you back this time<br>
                I know we decided if we both were free<br>
                But it kills me now<br><br>

                We said our last goodbye<br>

                Perfect night, pretend we're fine<br>
                Even just for a moment<br>
                Nowhere over, we're still not over<br>
                Pull me closer, I need closure<br>
                This is our last goodbye<br>
                Stay the night, even just for a moment<br>
                Even just for a moment<br>
                Even just for a moment<br><br>

                We said our last goodbye<br>
