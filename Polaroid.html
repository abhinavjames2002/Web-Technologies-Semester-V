                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                <i>[Liam Payne:]</i><br>
                Let me tell you how it happened<br>
                I wasn't looking for someone that night<br>
                No, I was never a believer<br>
                But you could fall in love at the first sight<br>
                <br>
                But all of a sudden<br>
                We loved and got lost in the moment<br>
                All of a sudden<br>
                She's gone in the flash of a light<br>
                I never was looking, hmm<br>
                I'll be looking for the rest of my life<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Liam Payne & Lennon Stella:]</i><br>
                We took a polaroid<br>
                You signed your name upon it<br>
                I put it in my wallet<br>
                Hoping I'd see your face again<br>
                We took a polaroid<br>
                Captured the look in your eyes<br>
                It's only a matter of time<br>
                Before it starts fading<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Lennon Stella:]</i><br>
                Was it my imagination?<br>
                I could've sworn I saw someone like you<br>
                A thousand people at the station<br>
                And in a second you slipped out of view<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Liam Payne:]</i><br>
                Then all of a sudden<br>
                I loved and got lost in the moment<br>
                All of a sudden<br>
                She's gone in the blink of an eye<br>
                I never was looking, hmm<br>
                I'll be looking for the rest of my life<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Liam Payne & Lennon Stella:]</i><br>
                We took a polaroid<br>
                You signed your name upon it<br>

                Before it starts fading<br>
                <br>
                We were dancing without moving<br>
                All my friends were leaving me behind<br>
                I didn't wanna catch a feeling<br>
                But there was something in that flashing light<br>
                <br>
                Then all of a sudden<br>
                I loved and got lost in the moment<br>
                All of a sudden<br>
                She's gone in the blink of an eye<br>
                I never was looking, hmm<br>
                I'll be looking for the rest of my life<br>
                <br>
                We took a polaroid<br>
                You signed your name upon it<br>

                I put it in my wallet<br>
                Hoping I'd see your face again<br><br>
