                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Used to be vulnerable<br>
                Used to be dumb<br>
                I used to give it all, mmm<br>
                Hot like a firestone<br>
                100 degrees<br>
                Oh but now I'm so cold when they kiss me, they touch me, they freeze<br>
                They say<br>
                <br>
                Why'd you never trust<br>
                Why'd you never love<br>
                Why'd you never let 'em in?<br>
                Why'd you wake up<br>
                With somebody in your bed again?<br>
                And say you love them till you leave<br>
                Why you out so late<br>
                Dancing with your fake friends<br>
                Getting in a state?<br>
                When the good guys come why'd you run away?<br>
                Why'd you hurt them?<br>
                Well I'll tell you<br>
                <br>
                When you're young and you get your heartbroken<br>
                And he leaves, leaves the scars open<br>
                When you can't believe it's over<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                Yeah, when your heart's broken<br>
                And he leaves, leaves the scars open<br>
                Drunk cry-crying on his shoulder<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                <br>
                They'd have to break me down<br>
                Show me real love<br>
                Oh but lately these boys, all they do is they fuck my head up<br>
                They say<br>
                <br>
                Why'd you never trust<br>
                Why'd you never love<br>
                Why'd you never let 'em in?<br>
                Why'd you wake up<br>
                With somebody in your bed again?<br>
                And say you love them till you leave<br>
                Don't you wanna stay<br>
                Don't you wanna try<br>
                Putting up a fight<br>
                Deep down you know<br>
                You know you could make it right<br>
                Don't just give in<br>
                Oh no<br>
                <br>
                When you're young and you get your heartbroken<br>
                And he leaves, leaves the scars open when you can't believe it's over<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                Yeah, when your heart's broken<br>
                And he leaves, leaves the scars open<br>
                Drunk cry-crying on his shoulder<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                <br>
                When you let your guard go<br>
                When you let your heart fall<br>
                When it starts to hurt oh<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                <br>
                When you're young and you get your heartbroken<br>
                And he leaves, leaves the scars open when you can't believe it's over<br>

                When you let your heart fall<br>
                When it starts to hurt oh<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br>
                When you let your guard go<br>
                When you let your heart fall<br>
                When it starts to hurt oh<br>
                That's when you get a little colder<br><br>
