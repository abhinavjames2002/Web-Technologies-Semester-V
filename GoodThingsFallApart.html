                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking?<br>
                Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?<br>
                Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?<br>
                Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type<br>
                Never really your type<br><br>
                
                Overthinking's got me drinking<br>
                Messing with my head, whoa<br><br>
                
                Tell me what you hate about me<br>
                Whatever it is, I'm sorry<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
                I know I can be dramatic<br>
                But everybody said we had it<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>

                I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
                I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br><br>

                When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you<br>
                Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night? That night?<br>
                That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car<br>
                'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December<br>
                Whoa<br><br>

                Tell me what you hate about me<br>
                Whatever it is, I'm sorry<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
                I know I can be dramatic<br>
                But everybody said we had it<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>

                I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
                I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br><br>

                Overthinking's got me drinking<br>
                Messing with my head, oh<br><br>

                Tell me what you hate about me (About me)<br>
                Whatever it is, I'm sorry (Oh, I'm sorry)<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, I'm sorry), yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
                I know I can be dramatic (I know I can be)<br>
                Everybody said we had it<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>

                I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
                I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br><br>
