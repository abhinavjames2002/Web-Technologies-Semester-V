                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                We could hide away in daylight<br>
                We go undercover, wait out the sun<br>
                Got a secret side in plain sight<br>
                Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run<br>
                <br>
                Everyday people do everyday things but I<br>
                Can't be one of them<br>
                I know you hear me now, we are a different kind<br>
                We can do anything<br>
                <br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes, me and you<br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes, me and you<br>
                We could be<br>
                <br>
                Anybody’s got the power<br>
                They don't see it cause they don't understand<br>
                Spin around and round for hours<br>
                You and me, we got the world in our hands<br>
                <br>
                Everyday people do everyday things but I<br>
                Can't be one of them<br>
                I know you hear me now, we are a different kind<br>
                We can do anything<br>
                <br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes, me and you<br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes, me and you<br>
                We could be<br>
                <br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                Me and you...<br>
                We could be<br>
                <br>
                All we're looking for is love and a little light<br>
                Love and a little light<br>
                (We could be)<br>
                All we're looking for is love and a little light<br>
                Love and a little light<br>
                <br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                We could be heroes<br>
                Me and you...<br>
                We could be<br><br>
