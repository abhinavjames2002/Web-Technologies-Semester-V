                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Remember when you said that all good things end<br>
                I never thought that I'd believe you<br>
                But now here I am, having lost a friend<br>
                And all the times I should've praised you<br>
                <br>
                I know my love, been showing off<br>
                How am I ever gonna get through?<br>
                'Cause I had my chance, but I blew it all<br>
                And now's my only time to tell you<br>
                <br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you<br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you (I'll drink to you)<br>
                <br>
                I was out of touch, didn't know my luck<br>
                You had everything I ever wanted<br>
                When I got lost, you came and stuck<br>
                And drifted off of my horizon<br>
                <br>
                So take me back, to where we began<br>
                I'll be everything you ever needed<br>
                If there's one last shot, I'll give you all I've got<br>
                Oh, lord knows that you deserve it<br>
                <br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you<br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you (I'll drink to you)<br>
                <br>
                When everything is said and done<br>
                The truth remains, you were my champion<br>
                When everything is said and done<br>
                The truth remains, you were the only one<br>
                <br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you<br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you<br>
                If the heavens crumble down<br>
                And the days we have are through, I'll drink to you<br>
                And when the silence is the sound<br>
                I know the one I'll owe it to, I'll drink to you (I'll drink to you)<br><br>
