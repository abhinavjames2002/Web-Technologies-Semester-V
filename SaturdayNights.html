                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos<br>
                Swishers make my throat hurt<br>
                Rolling OCB's on the side for me<br>
                Light 'em up and let 'em both burn<br>
                Family feuds, say your mom's confused<br>
                Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn<br>
                But daddy's gone, say he's never home<br>
                And wishing only makes it worse<br>
                <br>
                I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep<br>
                'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see<br>
                <br>
                All the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                They don't care like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                And all the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                They don't care like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                <br>
                Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos<br>
                Smell of cheap perfume<br>
                Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain<br>
                All the lies, they look like the truth<br>
                Deep in your heart, all you want is love<br>
                But you never felt good enough<br>
                You got wrapped up in other plans<br>
                But this ain't the way the story ends<br>
                <br>
                I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep<br>
                'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see<br>
                <br>
                All the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                They don't care like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                And all the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                They don't care like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                Nowhere like I do<br>
                <br>
                (Do, do, do)<br>
                'Cause I care, I care, I care about you<br>
                (Do, do, do)<br>
                There's nowhere I'd rather be<br>
                (Do, do, do)<br>
                Than right here around you<br>
                (Do, do, do)<br>
                I care, care, I care, care about you<br>
                (Do, do, do)<br>
                There's nowhere I'd rather be<br>
                <br>
                With all the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                They don't care about you<br>
                The way that I do<br>
                All the things that I know<br>
                That your parents don't<br>
                Don't care about you<br>
                The way that Iâ€” <br>
                The way that I do (Do, do, do)<br>
                The way that I do (Do, do, do)<br>
                The way that I do (Do, do, do)<br>
                The way that I do (Do, do, do)<br>
                The way that I do (Do, do, do)<br>
                I do (Do, do, do)<br><br>
