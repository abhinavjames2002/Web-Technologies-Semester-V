                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                I was a liar<br>
                I gave in to the fire<br>
                I know I should've fought it<br>
                At least I'm being honest<br>
                Feel like a failure<br>
                'Cause I know that I failed you<br>
                I should've done you better<br>
                'Cause you don't want a liar<br><br>
                            
                And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
                She gives you everything<br>
                But, boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
                And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
                That you got everything<br>
                But I got nothing here without you<br><br>
                            
                So one last time<br>
                I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
                One more time<br>
                I promise, after that, I'll let you go<br>
                Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
                All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>
                One last time<br>
                I need to be the one who takes you home<br><br>
                            
                I don't deserve it<br>
                I know I don't deserve it<br>
                But stay with me a minute<br>
                I swear I'll make it worth it<br>
                Can't you forgive me?<br>
                At least just temporarily<br>
                I know that this is my fault<br>
                I should've been more careful<br><br>
                            
                And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
                She gives you everything<br>
                But, boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
                And I know, and I know, and I know<br>
                That you got everything<br>
                But I got nothing here without you, baby<br><br>
                            
                So one last time<br>

                I know I should've fought it<br>
                At least I'm being honest (yeah)<br>
                But stay with me a minute<br>
                I swear I'll make it worth it, babe<br>
                'Cause I don't wanna be without you<br><br>
