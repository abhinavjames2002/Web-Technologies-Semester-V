                                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Always thought I was losing the race<br>
                Looking for love in all the wrong places<br>
                Really don't know how we made it here<br><br>
                            
                Never thought I was worth what you give<br>
                Never felt quite alive, now I'm living<br>
                Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear<br><br>
                            
                When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down<br>
                Hold me down, you do<br>
                Used to be scared of falling till you came around<br>
                Came around<br><br>
                            
                Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight<br>
                Want nobody else now, only you feel right<br>
                Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time<br>
                So stay till the morning, stay for a while<br>
                I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight<br>
                And fall right into you<br><br>
                            
                And fall right into you<br><br>
                            
                Like a rock, I was set in my ways<br>
                Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah<br>
                I was numb before but now I feel<br>
                            
                Any problem, we'll figure it out<br>
                Any love lost, we'll bring back around<br>
                Any broken heart, we'll make it heal<br><br>
                            
                When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down<br>
                Hold me down, you do<br>
                Used to be scared of falling till you came around<br>
                Came around<br><br>
                            
                Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight<br>
                Want nobody else now, only you feel right<br>

                And fall right into you<br>
                And fall right into you<br><br>
                            
                Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down<br>
                Hold me down, you do<br>
                Used to be scared of falling till you came around<br>
