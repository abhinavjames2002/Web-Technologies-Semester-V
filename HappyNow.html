                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                You're a world away<br>
                Somewhere in the crowd<br>
                In a foreign place<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                There's nothing left to say<br>
                So I shut my mouth<br>
                So won't you tell me, babe<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                <br>
                You're the only one who can up and run<br>
                Leave me just as empty as the day you came<br>
                And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts<br>
                Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain<br>
                <br>
                And only you know the strength of your teeth<br>
                The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep<br>
                And lonely<br>
                <br>
                You're a world away<br>
                Somewhere in the crowd<br>
                In a foreign place<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                There's nothing left to say<br>
                So I shut my mouth<br>
                So won't you tell me, babe<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                <br>
                (You're the only one who can)<br>
                <br>
                In the palm of your hands<br>
                You can make me dance<br>
                Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string<br>
                You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed<br>
                But don't you dare ask me how I've been<br>
                <br>
                Now only you know the strength of your teeth<br>
                The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep<br>
                And lonely<br>
                <br>
                You're a world away<br>
                Somewhere in the crowd<br>
                In a foreign place<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                There's nothing left to say<br>
                So I shut my mouth<br>
                So won't you tell me, babe<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                <br>
                (You're the only one who can<br>
                You're the only, you're the only<br>
                You're the only one who can<br>
                You're the only, you're the only)<br>
                <br>
                World away<br>
                Somewhere in the crowd<br>
                In a foreign place<br>
                Are you happy now?<br>
                There's nothing left to say<br>
                So I shut my mouth<br>
                So won't you tell me, babe<br>
                Are you happy now?<br><br>
