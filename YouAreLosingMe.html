                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                If could I take back what I said, I wouldn't<br>
                Cause this doesn't feel like love as I understood it<br>
                And I can't afford to throw you a line when I shouldn't<br>
                Cause you are losing me (Cause you are losing me)<br>
                <br>
                And I wish that I could change my point of view<br>
                So I could teach you the way I want to<br>
                And I hope you realize what you put me through<br>
                You are losing me<br>
                <br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                I wasn't loving someone new<br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                I was sleeping next to you<br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                You never broke my heart in two<br>
                And you weren't losing me<br>
                When I already lost you<br>
                <br>
                You're gonna wake up all alone in the morning<br>
                And you're gonna wish you could go back to before this<br>
                You're gonna tell all of your friends that you're broken<br>
                Cause you are losing me (Cause you are losing me)<br>
                <br>
                And I wish that I could change my point of view<br>
                So I could teach you the way I want to<br>
                And I hope you realize what you put me through<br>
                You are losing me<br>
                <br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                I wasn't loving someone new<br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                I was sleeping next to you<br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                You never broke my heart in two<br>
                And you weren't losing me<br>
                When I already lost you<br>
                <br>
                You're gonna wish that<br>
                You never broke my heart in two<br>
                And you weren't losing me<br>
                When I already lost you<br><br>
