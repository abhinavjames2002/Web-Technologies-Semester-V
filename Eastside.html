SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
[Khalid:]<br>
Uh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br><br>

When I was young, I fell in love<br>
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)<br>
Then we grew up, started to touch<br>
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)<br>
I know your daddy didn't like me much<br>
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one<br>
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late<br><br>

She used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
In the city where the sun don't set<br>
And every day, you know that we ride<br>
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette<br>
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight<br>
We can go anywhere we want<br>
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea<br>
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah<br><br>

We can do anything if we put our minds to it<br>
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it<br>
My love is yours if you're willing to take it<br>
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it<br>
So come away, starting today<br>
Start a new life together in a different place<br>
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be<br>
So baby, run away with me<br><br>

[Halsey:]<br>
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family<br>
A house, and everything in between<br>
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three<br>
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously<br>
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay<br>
Half our old friends are now our enemies<br>
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young<br>
Back to the day when I was falling in love<br><br>

He used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
In the city where the sun don't set<br>
And every day, you know where we'd ride<br>
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette<br>
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight<br>
We can go anywhere we want<br>
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea<br>
Just take my hand and come with me, singing<br><br>

[Halsey & Khalid:]<br>
We can do anything if we put our minds to it<br>
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it<br>
My love is yours if you're willing to take it<br>
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it<br>
So come away, starting today<br>
Start a new life together in a different place<br>
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be<br>
So baby, run away with me<br><br>

Run away, now<br>
Run away, now<br>
Run away, now<br>
Run away, now<br>
Run away, now<br>
Run away, now<br><br>

He used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
She used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
He used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
She used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
In the city where the sun don't set<br><br>
