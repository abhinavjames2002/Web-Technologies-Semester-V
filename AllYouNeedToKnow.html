                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Simple as can be<br>
                I got your hands in mine<br>
                And you don't have to listen carefully<br>
                I'll tell you a thousand times<br>
                <br>
                Anything you feel, put it all on me<br>
                All of your thoughts, I want everything<br>
                And when you get sad, like you do sometimes<br>
                Put it all on me<br>
                Put it all on me<br>
                <br>
                I'll lift you when you're feeling low<br>
                I'll hold you when the night gets cold<br>
                You'll never have to be alone<br>
                And that's all you need to know<br>
                No love lost, we've got you and I<br>
                No clouds, we shoot them out the sky<br>
                You'll never have to be alone<br>
                And that's all you need to know<br>
                And that's all you need to know<br>
                And that's all you need to know<br>
                <br>
                Simple as can be<br>
                I'm gonna be around<br>
                And you know we got everything we need<br>
                Look at this thing we found<br>
                <br>
                Anything you feel, put it all on me<br>
                Your fears and your thoughts, give me all of it<br>
                And when you get sad, like you do sometimes<br>
                Put it all on me<br>
                Put it all on me<br>
                <br>
                I'll lift you when you're feeling low<br>
                I'll hold you when the night gets cold<br>
                You'll never have to be alone<br>
