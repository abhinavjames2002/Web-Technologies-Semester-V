                Nicholas D. Miller (born December 26, 1990), known professionally as Illenium (stylized in all caps), is
                an American musician, DJ, and record producer. He has released four studio albums, his most recent being
                Fallen Embers, released in July 2021. One of Illenium's more notable albums, Ascend, was released in
                August 2019 on Astralwerks. The album was Illenium's first to top the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums
                chart and also reached his highest peak on the Billboard 200 at number 14.

                Several of Illenium's songs have appeared on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, including
                two singles in 2019 that peaked at number 3: "Good Things Fall Apart" with Jon Bellion and "Takeaway"
                with the Chainsmokers (featuring Lennon Stella). Illenium has also worked on numerous notable remixes,
                including those for the Chainsmokers' "Don't Let Me Down" and Flume's "Say It", the latter of which won
                the award for "Remix of the Year" at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards in 2017. He was included in
                the Forbes 30 Under 30 music list in 2020.<br><br>

                Nicholas D. Miller was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States on December 26, 1990. He was raised in
                San Francisco.In 2008, Miller began producing electronic music. In the summer of 2012, he saw Bassnectar perform at
                Red Rocks Amphitheatre and decided to focus more earnestly on music.[5] That year, he also suffered a
                heroin overdose; a fact he shared with his fans in 2018.[6] The experience was the inspiration for his
                2018 song, "Take You Down".[2] In 2013, Miller moved to Denver, where he continues to reside.[4][7] From
                2013 to 2014, he was enrolled in the Music & Entertainment Industry Studies (MEIS) Department at the
                University of Colorado Denver. His music emphasis was Recording Arts and he attended classes for two
                years. He made many connections in the Denver music scene while taking courses in music business,
                performance, and recording arts. During this period he completed his first EP. He also coached lacrosse
                and delivered sushi to support himself.<br><br>
