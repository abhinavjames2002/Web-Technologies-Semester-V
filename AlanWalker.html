                Alan Olav Walker (born 24 August 1997) is a British-Norwegian DJ, YouTuber and
                record producer, primarily known for the critically acclaimed single "Faded", which had received
                platinum certifications internationally in 14 countries since its launch on 3 December 2015. He is the
                second son of Briton Philip, and Norwegian Hilde Omdal Walker. He had an early interest in computing and
                music, and though he had no formal education in either, he was able to learn them from online
                tutorials.<br><br>

                Walker's artistic style was shaped and inspired by EDM producers K-391 and Ahrix, and film composers
                such as Hans Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky. In 2016, Walker left high school to continue his career, and
                has since participated in many on-stage performances; notable songs excluding "Faded" included Sing Me
                to Sleep", Alone, Darkside, and Routine, which all attracted millions of views. In early 2017, Walker's
                channel emerged as the most subscribed YouTube channel registered in Norway, with then 4.5 million
                subscribers. He also had the most views of Norwegian creators with an approximate 7.7 billion views as
                of 25 January 2020.<br><br>

                <b>EXCERPT TAKEN FROM ALAN WALKERS' OFFICIAL WEBSITE</b><br>
                Continuously delivering thumping beats and hypnotic records, 23-year old Norwegian DJ and Producer Alan
                Walker is truly a force to be reckoned with. With over 115 million followers across his social
                platforms, 8.7 billion YouTube views, and a staggering 50 billion audio and video streams, the young
                artist from Bergen, Norway is nowhere near kicking his feet up anytime soon. Alan Walker arrived on the
                music scene in late 2015 with his debut hit single Faded, garnering over a 1,3 billion Spotify streams
                and a massive 2.9 billion YouTube video views. Being the 19th most-watched music video on YouTube, the
                single also left him with a BRIT awards nomination for Song of the Year, as well as a Norwegian Grammy
                win in the same category. After building a massive social-following and releasing a string of successful
                singles like Alone and Darkside, collaborating with artists like Ava Max, Noah Cyrus, Sia, Bruno Mars
                and Coldplay, the chart-topping debut album Different World arrived in late 2018, amassing over 3,2
                billion streams on Spotify. While holding a pristine track record, Alan has played over 600 headlining
                shows and festivals to date, including Coachella and Tomorrowland, in addition to selling out his
                worldwide arena tours Aviation Tour. In 2021 Alan is upping the ante with astonishing new music and
                visuals, so buckle up, cause he’s just getting started.<br><br>
