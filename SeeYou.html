                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                I was with my friends<br>
                We missed the last train<br>
                Ran into your friends<br>
                And they pretended<br>
                Like nothing had changed<br>
                Like everything's alright<br>
                <br>
                I should've texted<br>
                Before I called you<br>
                I sent you a message<br>
                Maybe you missed it<br>
                Or it never went through<br>
                But it's been one of those nights<br>
                <br>
                Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
                Maybe it's foolish but...<br>
                <br>
                I don't wanna talk about us<br>
                I just wanna talk about how you've been lately<br>
                I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
                Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and<br>
                I don't need anything from you<br>
                And I know it's a little too soon<br>
                But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once<br>
                And I just wanna see you<br>
                <br>
                Nobody said this<br>
                Would ever be easy<br>
                The way that we left it<br>
                Would have such an influence on me<br>
                Wish I could turn back time<br>
                <br>
                Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
                Maybe it's foolish but...<br>
                <br>
                I don't wanna talk about us<br>
                I just wanna talk about how you've been lately<br>
                I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
                Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and<br>
                I don't need anything from you<br>
                And I know it's a little too soon<br>
                But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once<br>
                And I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br>
                <br>
                Oh I know it's late and you hate that I do this<br>
                Maybe it's foolish but...<br>
                <br>
                I don't wanna talk about us<br>
                I just wanna talk about how you been lately<br>
                I don't wanna get my hopes up<br>
                Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and<br>
                I don't need anything from you<br>

                And I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br>
                I just wanna see you<br><br>
