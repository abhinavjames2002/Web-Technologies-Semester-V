                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Should have, could have, would have, but it's too late<br>
                Shouldn't catch feelings on a first date<br>
                Woah, woah<br>
                0 to 100, no first base<br>
                Ended up with coffee back at your place<br>
                Woah, woah<br>
                <br>
                Every night is keeping me awake<br>
                I keep thinking about all the things that I would change<br>
                <br>
                If we could go back<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in<br>
                If we could turn back<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?<br>
                <br>
                Tryna win your heart but it's no race<br>
                Never had a time to find our own pace<br>
                Woah, woah<br>
                Tryna drive feelings that won't go away<br>
                Sleep in the bed of my own mistakes<br>
                Woah, woah<br>
                <br>
                Every night is keeping me awake<br>
                I keep thinking about all the things that I would change<br>
                <br>
                If we could go back<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in<br>
                If we could turn back<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?<br>
                <br>
                I know time waits for no man<br>
                I'm standing here now with no plans<br>
                Let's go, back<br>
                Go, go, back<br>
                I know time waits for no man<br>
                I'm standing here now with no plans<br>
                Let's go, back<br>
                Go, go, back<br>
                <br>
                If we could go back<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in<br>
                And if we could turn back (if we could come back)<br>
                Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?<br>
                Tell me would you still believe in me<br>
                Tell me would you still believe<br><br>
