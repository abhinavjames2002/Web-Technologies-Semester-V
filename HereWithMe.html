                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                Can I tell you something just between you and me?<br>
                When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free<br>
                Every single word is perfect as it can be<br>
                And I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                When you lift me up I know that I'll never fall<br>
                I can speak to you by saying nothing at all<br>
                Every single time I find it harder to breathe<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                Everyday<br>
                You're saying the words that I want you to say<br>
                There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away<br>
                Now I know I'm falling in deep<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                Everyday<br>
                You're saying the words that I want you to say<br>
                There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away<br>
                Now I know I'm falling in deep<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                I think I see your face in every place that I go<br>
                I try to hide it but I know that it's gonna show<br>
                Every single night I find it harder to sleep<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                Everyday<br>
                You're saying the words that I want you to say<br>
                There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away<br>
                Now I know I'm falling in deep<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                Everyday<br>
                You're saying the words that I want you to say<br>
                There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away<br>
                Now I know I'm falling in deep<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br>
                <br>
                Can I tell you something just between you and me?<br>
                When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free<br>
                Every single word is perfect as it can be<br>
                'Cause I need you here with me<br><br>
