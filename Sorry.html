                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty<br>
                You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies<br>
                I hope I don't run out of time. Could someone call a referee?<br>
                'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness<br>
                <br>
                I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice<br>
                And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times<br>
                So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight<br>
                'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances<br>
                <br>
                Yeah<br>
                Is it too late now to say sorry?<br>
                'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh<br>
                Is it too late now to say sorry?<br>
                Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br>
                <br>
                I'm sorry, yeah<br>
                Sorry yeah<br>
                Sorry<br>
                Yeah, I know that I let you down<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br>
                <br>
                I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to<br>
                But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two<br>
                I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth<br>
                Can we both say the words and forget this?<br>
                <br>
                Yeah<br>
                Is it too late now to say sorry?<br>
                'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh<br>
                Is it too late now to say sorry?<br>
                Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br>
                <br>
                I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no)<br>
                'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (your body), oh<br>
                Is it too late now to say sorry?<br>
                Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br>
                <br>
                I'm sorry, yeah<br>
                Sorry, oh<br>
                Sorry<br>
                Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down (let you down)<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br>
                <br>
                I'm sorry, yeah<br>
                Sorry, oh<br>
                Sorry<br>
                Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down (let you down)<br>
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?<br><br>
