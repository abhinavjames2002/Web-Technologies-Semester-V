            SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
            I was seeking with the boys<br>
            Talking shit and making noise<br>
            Like we had no other choice<br>
            It was like any other day<br>
            Can we do this other time<br>
            Then you fell back down the sky<br><br>
                        
            So what you doing girl<br>
            You just lit my world<br>
            Then you set it fire<br>
            I was Madonna, I was Mariah<br>
            And now you're taking me higher<br>
            In my new book, come the new hook<br>
            And I'm making you mine mine, girl<br><br>
