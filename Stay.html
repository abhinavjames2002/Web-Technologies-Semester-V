                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Waiting for the time to pass you by<br>
                Hope the winds of change will change your mind<br>
                I could give a thousand reasons why<br>
                And I know you, and you've got to<br><br>
                            
                Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up<br>
                We can stay forever young<br>
                Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola<br>
                Underneath the rising sun<br>
                I could give a thousand reasons why<br>
                But you're going, and you know that<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is stay a minute<br>
                Just take your time<br>
                The clock is ticking, so stay<br>
                All you have to do is wait a second<br>
                Your hands on mine<br>
                The clock is ticking, so stay<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is... uh<br>
                All you have to do is stay<br><br>
                            
                Won't admit what I already know<br>
                I've never been the best at letting go<br>
                I don't wanna spend the night alone<br>
                Guess I need you, and I need to<br><br>
                            
                Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up<br>
                We can stay forever young<br>
                Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola<br>
                Underneath the rising sun<br>
                I could give a million reasons why<br>
                But you're going, and you know that<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is stay a minute<br>
                Just take your time<br>

                The clock is ticking, so stay<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is... uh<br>
                All you have to do is stay<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is stay<br>
                So stay<br>
                Yeah<br><br>
                            
                All you have to do is stay a minute<br>
                Just take your time<br>
