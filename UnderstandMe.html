                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                Every day when the night falls and it's just you and me<br>
                Feelin' like you're made of stone and I ain't got an iron key<br>
                Can we vibe with the lights off? Tell me what do you see<br>
                Feelin' like you're made of stone<br>
                <br>
                Baby if you could understand me I wouldn't feel so empty<br>
                I don't wanna let you go ever let you go<br>
                Say you understand me<br>
                I'll give you my everything if you need let me go<br>
                Ever let me go I won't let you go-o<br>
                <br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                <br>
                Can't decide if you're the right one in your eyes I see<br>
                We're riding on a tide that turns how funny is the irony<br>
                Like you're alive wit' a mic on tell me do you ride for me<br>
                Breakin' down your the walls<br>
                <br>
                Baby if you could understand me I wouldn't feel so empty<br>
                I don't wanna let you go ever let you go<br>
                Say you understand me<br>
                I'll give you my everything if you need let me go<br>
                Ever let me go I won't let you go-o<br>
                <br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                <br>
                I can't lie to you<br>
                I keep on trying to meet you where you are<br>
                I don't know what to do<br>
                Can't say good bye to you<br>
                I cannot lie to you<br>
                I keep on trying to meet you where you are<br>
                I still make time for you 'cause I can't say good bye to you<br>
                <br>
                Baby if you could understand me I wouldn't feel so empty<br>
                I don't wanna let you go ever let you go<br>
                Say you understand me<br>
                I'll give you my everything if you need let me go<br>
                Ever let me go I won't let you go-o<br>
                <br>
                Oh yeah-yeah oo-oo<br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                No I'm not letting you go<br>
                I won't let you go-o<br>
                I'm not letting go<br>
                <br>
                'Cause I won't let you go-o<br><br>
