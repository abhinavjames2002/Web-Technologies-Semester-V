                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                I still remember that perfect smile<br>
                That you gave me the the first time I saw you<br>
                I knew it then and I still know now<br>
                That my darling I'll always adore you<br>
                <br>
                Promise me that you'll always be<br>
                The same person you've always been<br>
                And love me whether I'm strong or weak<br>
                Say you won't let go<br>
                Say you won't let go<br>
                <br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                But it doesn't change that all I see is you<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                Night with you, oh<br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                If heaven's a place then it was made for two<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                But I'd love to<br>
                Spend my life with you<br>
                <br>
                I swear it feels like you're made for me<br>
                By the way that our lips fit together<br>
                And when we lay in each others arms<br>
                Hope you know I could stay there forever<br>
                <br>
                Promise me that you'll always be<br>
                The same person you've always been<br>
                And love me whether I'm strong or weak<br>
                Say you won't let go<br>
                Say you won't let go<br>
                <br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                But it doesn't change that all I see is you<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                Night with you, oh<br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                If heaven's a place then it was made for two<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                But I'd love to<br>
                Spend my life with you<br>
                <br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                And everyone knows that all I need is you<br>
                I knew when I met you<br>
                I'd never forget this night with you<br>
                Night with you<br>
                <br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                But it doesn't change that all I see is you<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                Night with you, oh<br>
                I'm standing in a crowded room<br>
                If heaven's a place then it was made for two<br>
                I swear that you're perfect<br>
                I don't deserve this night with you<br>
                But I'd love to<br>
                Spend my life with you<br><br>
