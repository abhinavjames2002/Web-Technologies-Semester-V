                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                This has been a long night of mine<br>
                Switch all the lights without you by my side<br>
                I don't think I'm  alright in my mind<br>
                'Cause you're driving  me crazy, and you do it all the time<br><br>

                [Refrain]<br>
                And people say people do change<br>
                But I always thought that this was just a phase<br>
                I'd think you'd come back again, yeah<br>
                But no way, no<br><br>

                [Pre-Chorus]<br>
                'Cause baby, all I want<br>
                Is someone who'll be home around one (AM)<br>
                All I need<br>
                Is someone who will always pick me first<br><br>

                [Chorus]<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                Hanging with your friends out on the street<br>
                Wait for them to turn to enemies<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                And I can feel it slowly killing me<br>
                'Cause I remember who you used to be<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br><br>

                [Verse 2]<br>
                Tell me, what did I do to make you<br>
                Not even care about how I feel?<br>
                I could try to talk but you hang up<br>
                'Cause you're always out wasted with your brand new gang, yeah (Always out wasted)<br><br>

                [Refrain]<br>
                And people say people do change<br>
                But I always thought that this was just a phase<br>
                I'd think you'd come back again, yeah<br>
                But no way, no<br><br>

                [Pre-Chorus]<br>
                'Cause baby, all I want<br>
                Is someone who'll be home around one (AM)<br>
                All I need<br>
                Is someone who will always pick me first<br><br>

                [Chorus]<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                Hanging with your friends out on the street<br>
                Wait for them to turn to enemies<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                And I can feel it slowly killing me<br>
                'Cause I remember who you used to be<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br><br>

                [Bridge]<br>
                (Ayy) We used to be so fine, we had it alright<br>
                Back when you were tryna stay out all night<br>
                I remember your eyes in the moonlight<br>
                But I only get to see you [?] my mind<br>
                And I was super patient, got no more time<br>
                Right now I don't even feel like you're mine<br>
                You keep messing 'round, can you just pick a side?<br>
                Girl<br><br>

                [Chorus]<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                Hanging with your friends out on the street<br>
                Wait for them to turn to enemies<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br>
                I guess you just need bad company<br>
                And I can feel it slowly killing me<br>
                'Cause I remember who you used to be<br>
                Ooh, bad company<br><br>
