                I didn't know that I was broken<br>
                Until I found my missing piece<br>
                It seemed like every door was closing on me<br>
                And you were so far out of reach<br><br>
                            
                Drunk on the night, you got lips like your wine<br>
                I got nothing but time for you<br>
                Feeling so high on that look in your eyes<br>
                I got nothing but time for you<br><br>

                That loneliness is my disease (o-o-o-o-o-oh)<br>

                I didn't have no one to turn to<br>
                Yeah, I was circling the drain, mhm<br>
                Now you showed me I can learn too, yeah<br>
                How to be okay again, ooh<br><br>
