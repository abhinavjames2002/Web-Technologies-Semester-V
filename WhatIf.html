                <i>[Johnny:]</i><br>
                Let's talk about all the things that we shouldn't talk about<br>
                Those kind of words that will change all the things we talk about<br>
                Tell me do you ever think of us?<br>
                Should I ask some more or should I stop?<br>
                <br>
                What if our tomorrow means that we are here together?<br>
                What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?<br>
                Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?<br>
                What if I've been missing,<br>
                The writing on the wall?<br>
                <br>
                What if I say<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Johnny + Kenzie:]</i><br>
                I know, you know<br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                We stay, we go<br>
                <br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                I know, you know<br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                <br>
                We stay, we go<br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                <br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                <br>
                What if I told you I like you?<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Kenzie:]</i><br>
                I hear everything they saying, they saying 'bout us<br>
                It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love<br>
                Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?<br>
                Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?<br>
                <br>
                What if our tomorrow means that we are here together?<br>
                What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?<br>
                Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?<br>
                What if I've been missing,<br>
                The writing on the wall?<br>
                <br>
                What if I say<br>
                <br>
                <i>[Johnny + Kenzie:]</i><br>
                I know, you know<br>
