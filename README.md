# Web-Tech-Sem---V
 Mini Project Semester V
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

This is a sleek music website that consists of cards 
containing album covers of some of my favourite songs.

The cards have shadow properties and hover effects for 
better user interaction.

When pressed...it will open a new webpage having two big cards,
one of which the same album cover on the left side of the page 
along with the song controller.

The card on the right will have the lyrics of the song !

I have also added a dedicated song contribution section 
which will have the artist names....which again have the hover 
and shadow effects and also can be clicked to view the information
about each artist !

The user interface will surely amaze you.

I hope you have the same amount of fun that I had while making this !

CHEERS ðŸ¥‚
