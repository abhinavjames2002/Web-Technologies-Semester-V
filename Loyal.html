                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                I’m problematic<br>
                It’s automatic<br>
                They say I’m a waste a<br>
                Pretty face with a<br>
                Reckless taste and I<br>
                And I can't help myself I'm<br>
                Burning bridges and counting stitches<br>
                Everyday it′s someone different<br>
                There′s something missing<br><br>

                Then I found you in all of the mistakes<br>
                That led me to your place<br>
                I know that something's changed, ′cause I wanna stay<br><br>

                I've never been loyal<br>
                I′ve always been selfish with my love<br>
                Was running in circles<br>
                But it's you I run to now<br>
                Forget what they told ya<br>
                I′m leaving my habits at the door<br>
                I've never been loyal<br>
                But I'll always be loyal to you<br><br>

                But I′ll always be loyal to you<br><br>

                I was a liar, I lit a fire<br>
                But never with you, I′ll keep it honest<br>
                And that's a promise to hold me to<br>
                You got me living this new religion<br>
                There′s no going back now<br>
                Something's different, no, nothing′s missing<br><br>

                'Cause I found you in all of the mistakes<br>
                That led me to your place<br>
                I know that something′s changed, 'cause I wanna stay<br><br>

                I've never been loyal<br>
                I′ve always been selfish with my love<br>
                Was running in circles<br>
                But it′s you I run to now<br>
                Forget what they told ya<br>
                I'm leaving my habits at the door<br>
                I′ve never been loyal<br>
                But I'll always be loyal to you<br><br>

                But I′ll always be loyal to you<br>
                But I'll always be loyal to you<br>
                Whoa, oh-oh-oh<br><br>

                I′ve never been loyal<br>
                I've always been selfish with my love<br>
                Was running in circles<br>
                But it's you I run to now<br>
                Forget what they told ya<br>
                I′m leaving my habits at the door<br>
                Never been loyal<br>
                But I′ll always be loyal to you<br>
                Yeah, I'll always be loyal to you<br><br>

                But I′ll always be loyal to you<br>
                Yeah, I'll always be loyal to you<br><br>
