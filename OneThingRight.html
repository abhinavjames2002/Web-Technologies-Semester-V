                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>

                I've cheated and I've lied<br>
                I've broke down and I've cried<br>
                I've got nothing to hide no more<br>
                I've loved and I've hurt<br>
                I've broken people down with words<br>
                More grace than I deserved, for sure<br>
                <br>
                Known to be crazy, known to be wild<br>
                Mama had herself a little devilish child<br>
                Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door<br>
                <br>
                I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time<br>
                Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life<br>
                Been every kinda lost that you can't find<br>
                But I got one thing right<br>
                Been the kind of guy girl's mamas don't like<br>
                Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights<br>
                'Cause I've been wrong about a million times<br>
                But I got one thing right, you<br>
                <br>
                (Baby, I got one thing right)<br>
                Mm<br>
                (Baby, I got one thing right)<br>
                Yeah, I got you<br>
                (Baby, I got one thing right)<br>
                I got one thing right<br>
                <br>
                You saw right through my pain<br>
                Kept us patient while I changed<br>
                Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)<br>
                When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild<br>
                Actin' like my mama's little devilish child<br>
                It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)<br>
                <br>
                I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time<br>
                Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life<br>
                Been every kinda lost that you can't find<br>
                But I got one thing right<br>
                Been the kind of guy girl's mamas don't like<br>
                Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights<br>
                'Cause I've been wrong about a million times<br>
                But I got one thing right, you<br>
                <br>
