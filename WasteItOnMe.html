                SING ALONG WITH THE LYRICS<br><br>
                (Waste it on me)<br><br>
                            
                You say love is messed up<br>
                You say that it don't work<br>
                You don't wanna try, no, no<br>
                (You don't wanna try, no, no)<br>
                And baby, I'm no stranger<br>
                To heartbreak and the pain of<br>
                Always being let go (Always being let go)<br>
                            
                And I know there's no making this right, this right (This right)<br>
                And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)<br>
                But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)<br>
                So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time<br>
                            
                Waste it on me, waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br><br>
                            
                So we don't gotta go there<br>
                Past lovers and warfare<br>
                It's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)<br>
                I don't know your secrets<br>
                But I'll pick up the pieces<br>
                Pull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)<br><br>
                            
                And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)<br>
                And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)<br>
                But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)<br>
                So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time<br><br>
                            
                Waste it on me, waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not?<br><br>
                            
                Yay, don't you think there must be a reason<br>
                Yeah, like we had our names<br>
                Don't you think we got another season<br>
                That come after spring<br>
                I wanna be your summer<br>
                I wanna be your wave<br>
                Treat me like a comma<br>
                And I'll take you to a new phrase<br>
                Yeah, come just eat me and throw me away<br>
                If I'm not your taste, babe, waste<br>
                Waste it on me<br><br>
                            
                And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)<br>
                And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)<br>
                But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)<br>
                So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time<br><br>
                            
                Waste it on me, waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me<br>
                (Waste it on me)<br>
                Tell me, why not?<br><br>
